# Minecraft Neuro-sama Mod

## Introduction to Neuro-sama

Neuro-sama is an AI VTuber. Not only can she chat and watch videos, but she can also play games such as Osu! and Minecraft.

In fact, Neuro-sama was born as an Osu! player. She is so powerful that she has beaten top Osu! player Mrekk.

However, she is not as powerful in Minecraft; in fact, she has some strange actions, such as falling into lava, mining bedrock, etc. This Minecraft mod is going to feature these.

## Others

This mod is NOT part of Neuro-sama ARG, but I would like to include some elements of it.

In fact, I also want to solve the ARG, but cryptography is too difficult for me. So I can only make Minecraft mod instead.
